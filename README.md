A lightweight Streamlit app that pulls Indian phone numbers out of any blob of text and hands you back a clean CSV. That's pretty much it — but it does it really well (~99% accuracy).

---

## What's it for?

Got a wall of text with phone numbers scattered throughout? Paste it in, hit extract, download your CSV. Whether it's customer data, scraped content, form responses, or anything else — this saves you the headache of hunting them down manually.

Built specifically for **Indian phone numbers** (think `+91`, `98201 23456`, `022-49871234`, `7865043210` — all the usual formats).

---

## Features

- 📋 **Paste raw text** directly into the app
- 📁 **Upload a `.txt` file** if your text is too long to paste
- 👀 **Preview** extracted numbers before downloading
- 📥 **Download as CSV** — ready to plug into whatever workflow you've got
- Works with text in **any language**, as long as the phone numbers are in Latin script
- No character limit on input... for now (a 25,000 character cap is coming in a future update)

## Got images with phone numbers?

This app works on text, so if your numbers are stuck inside an image, you'll need to OCR it first. A few solid options:

- [OCR.best](https://ocr.best) — quick and free
- [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision) — powerful, great for bulk
- [Adobe Acrobat OCR](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/pdf-to-word.html) — good for PDFs with embedded images

Once you've got the text out, paste it straight into the app.

---

## Built With

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) — UI framework
- [phonenumbers](https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers) — phone number parsing library

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] 25,000 character limit on raw text input
- [ ] Support for `.csv`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.html`, `.md` uploads
- [ ] Web scraping support
- [ ] Become your one-stop shop for anything phone-number-related 🫡
