# About Us
Find this repo on GitHub: [phonenums-melodyofasong](https://github.com/melodyofasong/phonenums-melodyofasong)

A Python project built with **Streamlit** and the **phonenumbers** library to extract phone numbers from large bodies of text, built exclusively for **Indian phone numbers** with **99% accuracy**.

## What it does
Paste or upload a text document and get back a clean, ready-to-use **CSV file** of all the phone numbers found — including whether each number is a **mobile**, **landline**, or **unknown** type. Perfect for plugging straight into your workflow.

## How to use it
- **Paste** your text directly into the textbox on the main page, or
- **Upload** a text file
- Press **Extract →** or hit `Enter` on your keyboard

Your text can be in **any language**, as long as the phone numbers are written in **Latin script**.

> **Note:** There is currently no character limit on the raw text input, paste as much as you like. A **25,000 character limit** will be introduced in a future update.

## Output format
Results are shown in a preview table with two columns — the phone number in international format, and its type (mobile, landline, or unknown). You can download this as a CSV with one click, and a confirmation will appear when the file is saved.

## Supported file types
Currently supported: `.txt`

Coming soon: `.csv`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.html`, `.md`
We're working on becoming your **one-stop shop for anything phone number-related**, including web scraping support.

## Got images with text?
If your phone numbers are buried in an image, run it through an OCR tool first and then paste the extracted text here. Some good options:

- [OCR.best](https://ocr.best)
- [Google Cloud Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision)
- [Adobe Acrobat OCR](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/online/pdf-to-word.html)
